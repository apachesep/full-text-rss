### About 關於

See <http://fivefilters.org/content-only/> for a description of the code.

### Installation 安裝方法

/ 請[下載壓縮檔](https://github.com/pulipulichen/full-text-rss/archive/master.zip)，解壓縮到你的電腦中

2. FTP the files up to your server 
/ 將檔案上傳到你的伺服器

3. Access index.php through your browser. E.g. http://example.org/full-text-rss/index.php
/ 開啟index.php網頁，例如 http://example.org/full-text-rss/index.php

4. Enter a URL in the form field to test the code
/ 輸入網址遞交表單，測試看能不能順利運作

5. If you get an RSS feed with full-text content, all is working well. :)
/ 如果網頁正常顯示全文RSS資訊來源，那就是正常運作了！ :)

### Configuration (optional) 設定 (可選)

1. Save a copy of config.php as custom_config.php and edit custom_config.php

2. If you decide to enable caching, make sure the cache folder (and its 2 sub folders) is writable. (You might need to change the permissions of these folders to 777 through your FTP client.)

3. If extraction always failed, please try to increase "max_execution_time", "max_input_time", and "memory_limit" in your server's php.ini and restart server.
/ 如果文章抽取總是失敗，請嘗試設定php.ini的"max_execution_time"、"max_input_time"與"memory_limit"，並重新啟動伺服器。

### Site-specific extraction rules 特定網站的抽取規則

This free version does not contain the site config files we include with purchased copies, but these are now all available [online](https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config). If you'd like to keep yours up to date using Git, follow the steps below:

1. Change into the site_config/standard/ folder
2. Delete everything in there
3. Using the command line, enter: `git clone https://github.com/pulipulichen/full-text-rss.git .`
4. Git should now download the latest site config files for you.
5. To update the site config files again, you can simply run `git pull` from the directory.

### Code example 程式碼範例

If you're developing an application which requires content extraction, you can call Full-Text RSS as a web service from within your application. Here's how to do it in PHP:

	<?php
	// $ftr should be URL where you installed this application
	$ftr = 'http://example.org/full-text-rss/';
	$article = 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21936308';

	$request = $ftr.'makefulltextfeed.php?format=json&url='.urlencode($article);

	// Send HTTP request and get response
	$result = @file_get_contents($request);

	if (!$result) die('Failed to fetch content');

	$json = @json_decode($result);

	if (!$json) die('Failed to parse JSON');

	// What do we have?
	// var_dump($json);
	
	// Items?
	// var_dump($json->rss->channel->item);

	$title = $json->rss->channel->item->title;
	// Note: this works when you're processing an article.
	// If the input URL is a feed, ->item will be an array.

	echo $title;

### Different language? 搭配其他語言

Although we don't have examples in other programming languages, the essential steps should be:

1. Construct the request URL using URL where you installed Full-Text RSS and the article or feed URL (see $ftr, $article, $request in example above).

2. Fetch the resulting URL using an HTTP GET request.

3. Parse the HTTP response body as JSON and grab what you need.
